<p>I love to play video games with my brothers and my friends. We all play together weekly.<br> We mainly play FIFA and Call of Duty. My current favourite game is Fortnite.<br> This is the most popular game out there at the moment.<br> We usually play for the laugh but occasionally we take it seriously. This really helps me with my communication skills with others.<br> It is a great way to pass time when used in moderation.</p>
