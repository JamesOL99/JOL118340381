<p>I listen to music every day. I listen on to go, when walking around, driving or when relaxing.<br> I find it very calming and itâ€™s a nice way to pass time. <br>My favourite artists are The Chainsmokers. I listen to them every day and was lucky enough to see them in person once in Dublin at Summer in the City. My favourite song of theirs is Closer.<br> I also really like Drake and am going to see him soon in the 3Arena. Gods plan is the song he has released in my opinion.</br>
