<p>Without doubt the future of the business place and household is with Autonomous Things. AI makes everyday life much easier at the moment. AI can switch off lights and order shopping on command. The only way is up and the possibilities are endless when it comes to Autonomous Things. Self driving cars, AI that performs surgery, AI bomb defusal units and AI personal assistants are all in development. According to experts the following AI will be available in 2020. </p>

<h3>Robotics technology in 2020:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Microbots </b>allow emergency responders to explore environments that are too small or too dangerous for humans or larger robots; deploying them in “swarms” compensates for their relatively limited computational ability.
<li><b>Exoskeletons</b> allow users to augment their physical strength, helping those with physical disabilities to walk and climb, it also finds application in the military.
<li><b>Body-machine interfaces</b> help amputees to feed-forward controls that detect their will to move and also receive sensorial feedback that converts digital readings to feelings.
<li><b>Modular robots</b> bring forth LEGO® like robotic cubes that can arrange themselves in preset patterns to accomplish specific tasks.
<li><b>Intelligent robots</b> combine artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to give robots human-like expressions and reactions.
<li><b>Robotic strength increases as elastic nanotubes</B> give robots muscles that are more compact and stronger than human muscles; allowing robots to outrun and out-jump humans.
<li><b>Alternately powered robots</b> use sources like solar, wind and wave energy to be powered indefinitely and open up applications in areas that are off-grid.
<li><b>Robotic networks</b> emerge and allow robots to access databases, share information and learn from one another’s experience.
<li><b>Telepresence robots</b> act as your stand-in at remote locations saving business travelers both time and money.
