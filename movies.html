<p>I also am a fan of watching the movies. My favourite genre is Sci-Fi.<br> I love the Star Wars and Marvel movies. My favourite move is Avengers: Infinity War.<br> The ending caught me by surprise and the character development of the Antagonist was one of the best I have ever seen. I look for the next chapter in the saga.<br> I also enjoy action/adventure movies. Movies such as Mission Impossible can be so exciting to watch. With such death defying stunt work, it is hard not to appreciate the effort made by the cast</p>
