<p>Whether it is playing or watching the sport, I can not get enough of the sport.<br> I played the sport up until Junior Level as a goalkeeper for Douglas Hall and for the college team. I captained and I received the Andrew Fealy award at U16 level with Douglas Hall. <br>This sport thought me the importance of concentration and team work.<br>

With regards to watching soccer, I support Manchester United. I have followed them since early childhood. <br>I try not to miss a game and have attended a dozen live games. I watch all the games with my family.<br> I could talk forever about the team. My favourite current player is David de Gea as he is also a goalkeeper. </P>
