I love to travel. I have been too America and Europe many times.<br> I love visiting the most popular tourist attractions, mainly the theme parks.<br> I usually travel with my family, even though it is hard to convince them to come along on the rollercoasters.<br> I would have to say my favourite destination is Florida. Witnessing the different culture, was an experience to remember. It was such a diverse society. <br>Everything over there seemed extra large when compared to us in Ireland. The shopping centres and meals were almost twice the size as here.
