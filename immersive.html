<h1>Immersive Experiences</h1>
  <a class="nav-link" href="Business.html">Back</a>
<p>Immersive experiences are designed to engage peoples senses often several senses, simultaneously.  And, amid the sights, sounds, touches, smells and maybe even tastes, people tend to have heightened awareness because we pay attention when novelty is high.  With greater awareness often comes stronger emotional reactions, as well.</p>
<br>
<p>Immersive experiences presumably can result from the use of surround sound, handheld video games, virtual/augmented reality headsets, large 3D projected imagery, giant screen theaters, and simulators to note a few.  It often gives the participants the impression that they are in the environment that is depicted. Therefore, some refer to it as an illusory environment.</p><br>
<p>Amusement parks and museums historically have excelled in this arena.   Notable recently is the National Geographic Encounter called Ocean Odyssey.   Also gaining in popularity are immersive theatres and variously themed escape rooms.<br>
People simply find these experiences fun, engaging and exciting. This is particularly true for younger consumers. Seventy two percent say they would like to increase their spending on experiences rather than physical things in the coming year, according to Eventbrite. Developers recognize this appetite and find profitability in experiential destinations that satisfy this growing pool of consumers.<br>
Immersive experiences are valued for their ability to tell a great story.  Akin to getting lost in a great novel, immersion can offer the perception of being physically present in a non-physical world.  Stimuli from within a VR/AR headset or from within a creatively, well designed technology-infused space can offer engrossing environments that transport participants.  In such a state, people take on unique perspectives and can be persuaded to feel certain emotions. They can be enticed to behave in predictable ways.</P>
<br>
<h3>Immersive VR/AR experiences can be uniquely persuasive in situations such as the following.</h3>
<ul>
<li>When travelers are allowed to virtually explore a foreign city prior to purchasing a ticket. When future students are permitted to stroll through campus months before committing to a universityâ€™s recruitment offer
<li>When occupants are encouraged to walk in a newly architected building or workspace before contracts are signed and construction begins
<li>When executives and subject matter experts are offered a chance to visualize large machinery incorporated into existing configurations before allocating funds for the capital expenses
<li>When colleagues are exposed to emotional interactions as a precursor to soft skills training
<li>When potential talent is engrossed in mission-focused storytelling as part of a robust hiring protocol
</ul>
